# Detecting Cancer Through DNA: My Journey Building a ctDNA Detection System with Machine Learning

## Using CNNs and SVMs to identify circulating tumor DNA — a technical deep-dive

Cancer detection has always been a race against time. The earlier we detect it, the better the chances of survival. But what if we could detect cancer by analyzing tiny fragments of tumor DNA circulating in the bloodstream? That's exactly what my Master's thesis project aimed to solve.

In this article, I'll walk you through how I built a machine learning system to **identify Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA)** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)**.

## What is ctDNA and Why Does It Matter?

**Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA)** refers to small fragments of DNA that tumor cells shed into the bloodstream. Unlike traditional biopsies that require invasive procedures, detecting ctDNA from a simple blood test offers:

**Non-invasive detection** — Just a blood sample  
**Early cancer detection** — Before symptoms appear  
**Treatment monitoring** — Track how well therapy is working  
**Recurrence detection** — Catch cancer coming back early  

The challenge? ctDNA makes up less than 1% of the total DNA in blood. Finding it is like searching for a needle in a haystack.

---

## The Challenge: How Do You Detect Something So Rare?

Traditional DNA sequencing methods are expensive and time-consuming. Machine learning offered a different approach:

**The Question:** Can we use image-based analysis and pattern recognition to identify ctDNA?

**The Hypothesis:** If we convert DNA sequences into visual representations (spectrograms), we can use computer vision techniques to detect patterns that indicate tumor DNA.

This is where **CNNs** (masters of image recognition) and **SVMs** (excellent binary classifiers) come into play.

---

## The Technical Approach: From DNA to Detection

### Step 1: DNA to Image Transformation

First challenge: DNA sequences are text (ATCG bases), but CNNs work with images. The solution?

**Spectrogram Imaging & Digital Mapping**

1. **Convert DNA sequences to numerical signals** using digital signal processing
2. **Generate spectrograms** — visual representations showing frequency patterns
3. **Apply Canny Edge Detection** to highlight structural features

This transformed biological data into something a CNN could understand.

```python
# Conceptual workflow (simplified)
dna_sequence = "ATCGATCG..."
numerical_signal = dna_to_signal(dna_sequence)
spectrogram = generate_spectrogram(numerical_signal)
edge_detected = apply_canny_edge_detection(spectrogram)
```

### Step 2: CNN Architecture for ctDNA Detection

I designed a **Convolutional Neural Network** specifically for ctDNA pattern recognition:

**Architecture Highlights:**
- **Input Layer:** Spectrogram images of DNA sequences
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extract hierarchical features (edges → patterns → structures)
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduce dimensionality while preserving important features
- **Fully Connected Layers:** Classification decision-making
- **Output:** Binary classification (ctDNA vs. normal DNA)

**Why CNNs?**
- Excellent at learning spatial hierarchies in images
- Can detect subtle patterns humans might miss
- Robust to variations in DNA representation

**Framework:** Built using **Keras** with TensorFlow backend

### Step 3: SVM for DNA Classification

While the CNN handled image-based detection, I also implemented a **Support Vector Machine** approach:

**SVM Methodology:**
1. **Feature extraction** from DNA sequences (GC content, mutation patterns, etc.)
2. **Kernel selection** — Tested RBF, polynomial, and linear kernels
3. **Hyperparameter tuning** for optimal decision boundary

**Why SVM?**
- Excellent for binary classification (tumor vs. normal)
- Works well with high-dimensional data
- Strong mathematical foundation
- Less prone to overfitting with proper regularization

**Framework:** Implemented using **scikit-learn**

### Step 4: Hybrid Approach

The real power came from combining both approaches:

```
DNA Sample
    ↓
    ├─→ Spectrogram → CNN → Detection Score
    └─→ Feature Extraction → SVM → Classification Score
              ↓
        Ensemble Decision
```

This hybrid system leveraged:
- **CNN's strength** in pattern recognition from visual data
- **SVM's precision** in classification with engineered features

**Presenting this research** taught me:

- The importance of reproducible results
- How academic research differs from industry projects

## What This Project Taught Me About ML

### 1. **ML is More Than Models**
Building a CNN is easy. Building one that solves a real problem requires understanding:
- The domain (biology/oncology)
- The data (DNA structures)
- The constraints (computational limits)

### 2. **Feature Engineering Still Matters**
Even with deep learning, how you represent your data makes all the difference. Our spectrogram approach was key to success.

### 3. **Validation is Everything**
In healthcare applications, you can't afford false negatives. Rigorous testing and validation were non-negotiable.

### 4. **Interdisciplinary Work is Powerful**
Combining biology, signal processing, computer vision, and machine learning created something greater than any single field could achieve.

## Looking Back: From Academic Project to Career Direction

This project was a turning point. It showed me that:

- **AI can solve meaningful problems** beyond just classification tasks
- **Computational biology** is an exciting frontier
- **I wanted to work in NLP** because language, like DNA, is a sequence-based problem

The techniques I learned here — sequence analysis, pattern recognition, classification — directly translated to my later work in **Natural Language Processing** using **Transformers**.

Both DNA and language are sequences. Both require understanding context. Both benefit from deep learning.

## For Aspiring ML Practitioners

If you're working on a similar project or considering ML in healthcare:

### **Do This:**

**Start with a clear problem** — What exactly are you trying to detect/classify?  
**Understand your data deeply** — Visualize it, explore it, understand its quirks  
**Try multiple approaches** — Don't marry yourself to one algorithm  
**Validate rigorously** — Healthcare applications require high standards  
**Document everything** — Your future self will thank you

### **Avoid This:**

Jumping straight to complex models without understanding the data  
Ignoring domain expertise (talk to biologists/doctors!)  
Over-relying on a single metric (accuracy isn't everything)  
Skipping proper validation (train/test leakage is real)

## The Code (Conceptual Overview)

While I can't share the full implementation, here's a simplified conceptual workflow:

```python
# 1. Data Preparation
dna_sequences = load_dna_data()
spectrograms = convert_to_spectrograms(dna_sequences)
features = extract_dna_features(dna_sequences)

# 2. CNN Pipeline
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout

model_cnn = Sequential([
    Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128,128,1)),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu'),
    MaxPooling2D((2,2)),
    Flatten(),
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.5),
    Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

model_cnn.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
model_cnn.fit(spectrograms, labels, epochs=50, validation_split=0.2)

# 3. SVM Pipeline
from sklearn.svm import SVC
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

scaler = StandardScaler()
features_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(features)

model_svm = SVC(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, gamma='scale')
model_svm.fit(features_scaled, labels)

# 4. Ensemble Prediction
cnn_pred = model_cnn.predict(test_spectrograms)
svm_pred = model_svm.predict(test_features)
final_prediction = ensemble_vote(cnn_pred, svm_pred)
```
