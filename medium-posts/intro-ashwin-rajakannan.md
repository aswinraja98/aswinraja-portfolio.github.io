# From Electronics to AI: My Journey as an ML Developer

## How curiosity turned into a career building intelligent systems

Hi, I'm Ashwin Rajakannan, an AI/ML Developer specializing in NLP and data engineering. If you told my undergraduate self that I'd be building transformer models and data pipelines a few years later, I would have been skeptical. But here I am, and this is my story.

## The Foundation: Electronics to Software

My journey started with a **B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering** from SRM Institute. Like many engineering students, I was fascinated by how systems work—circuits, signals, processors. But somewhere along the way, I discovered something even more intriguing: **how machines could learn**.

That curiosity led me to pursue an **M.E in Software Engineering at Anna University's College of Engineering, Guindy**. This wasn't just a degree change; it was a mindset shift. I went from building hardware systems to creating intelligent software that could adapt, learn, and improve.

## First Breakthrough: Cancer Detection with AI

During my academic journey, I worked on a project that would define my passion for machine learning: **Identifying Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) using CNNs and SVMs**.

The problem was fascinating—could we use machine learning to detect cancer markers in DNA? We applied:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for ctDNA detection
- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** for DNA classification
- **Spectrogram imaging** and digital mapping with Keras
- **Canny edge detection** for feature extraction

The research was [published in IRJET](https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I413.pdf), but more importantly, it taught me something crucial: **AI isn't just about algorithms—it's about solving real-world problems**.

## Real-World Experience: Building Production Systems

### 🔹 **Assisto Technologies** (Junior ML Developer, Apr 2023 - Jun 2023)

This was my first deep dive into **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. I worked with state-of-the-art transformer models:
- **MT5, T5, and Byt5** for multilingual text processing
- **Jina AI and Haystack** for optimizing data pipelines
- API integration and model performance tuning

Working with transformers from Hugging Face was like unlocking a superpower. These models could understand context, generate text, and process multiple languages—all things that seemed like science fiction just a few years ago.

### 🔹 **SATURAM** (Trainee Data Engineer, Jan 2022 - Jul 2022)

Here, I learned the backbone of ML systems: **data engineering**. Building RESTful APIs with Flask, writing efficient SQL queries, containerizing applications with Docker, and web scraping taught me that:

> **Good ML models need great data pipelines.**

This experience shaped my philosophy: precision in data engineering leads to better model performance.

## The Modern ML Stack: What I Work With

My toolkit has evolved based on what actually works in production:

**Core Programming:**
- **Python** for everything ML/AI
- **C++** for performance-critical components
- **SQL** for data manipulation

**ML/AI Frameworks:**
- **Hugging Face Transformers** (my favorite for NLP)
- **TensorFlow & PyTorch** for deep learning
- **Scikit-learn** for classical ML

**Data Engineering:**
- **Flask** for API development
- **Pandas & NumPy** for data processing
- **Docker** for containerization
- **Azure** for cloud deployment

**AI-Assisted Development:**
- **GitHub Copilot** for code suggestions
- **ChatGPT & Claude** for problem-solving
- **Google Gemini** for research

Yes, I embrace AI tools in my workflow. Why? Because the best developers use the best tools available.

## What Drives Me

I'm not just chasing certifications or adding technologies to my resume. What excites me is:

1. **Building systems that learn and adapt** - Every model that improves its performance feels like a small victory
2. **NLP's potential to break language barriers** - Multilingual models can democratize information access
3. **The intersection of data engineering and ML** - Clean pipelines make everything else possible

As I mentioned in my portfolio:

> *"My achievements aren't measured in numbers—they're reflected in every model that learns, adapts, and performs better than before."*

## What's Next?

I'm actively seeking opportunities where I can:
- Build **production-grade NLP systems**
- Design **scalable data pipelines**
- Work with teams pushing the boundaries of **AI/ML applications**

I'm particularly interested in roles that combine **research and engineering**—where I can both experiment with cutting-edge models and deploy them to solve real problems.

## Final Thoughts

The journey from electronics to AI wasn't linear, but every detour taught me something valuable. Whether it was debugging a neural network at 2 AM or optimizing a data pipeline that processed millions of records, each challenge shaped my approach to problem-solving.

**To anyone starting their ML journey:** Don't just learn frameworks—understand the problems you're solving. Build projects that matter to you. And most importantly, stay curious.

Because in this field, curiosity isn't just an advantage—it's the fuel that keeps you going.
